Topic Specific Web Crawler
==========================

A distributed crawler that traverses the web, looking for HTML and XML documents that match one of the XPath expressions, and caches them in Oracle Berkeley DB.Java.
`Spring 2013`

## _Skills_
        Java, Servlet, Berkeley DB, XML, XPath, XSLT

## _Contribution_
1. Built a web application that runs on web server implemented by me that allows users to create topic-specific "channels" defined by XPaths expressions, and displays mathched documents using XSLT.
2. Developed an XPath evaluation engine that determines if an HTML or XML document matches one of the XPath expressions.
3. Implemented a persistent database using Oracle Berkeley DB that managed crawled documents, users and channels.
